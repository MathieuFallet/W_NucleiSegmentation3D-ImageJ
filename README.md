# Nuclei Segmentation 3D

Segment 3D nuclei using Gaussian Blur 3D, thresholding, 3D fill holes and a binary Distance Transform Watershed 3D

The parameters are the input folder, the output folder, the radius of the gaussian filter and the threshold value.

## Integration with NEUBIAS web-based database of bioimage analysis tools 
This workflow is described in [www.biii.eu](www.biii.eu) in [http://biii.eu/nuclei-segmentation-3d-imagej](http://biii.eu/nuclei-segmentation-3d-imagej)
